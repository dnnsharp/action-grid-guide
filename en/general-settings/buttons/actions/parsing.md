# Parsing

## Regex

When you want to parse multiple values at once from the same Input, you can set this as action on your button. We use this action with API Endpoint when creating methods, an example is provided on the API Methods page in this documentation, on the case where we created a method which is invoked from Server side from an HTTP request.
