## Collect PayPal Payment

Action Form allows you to set a PayPal payment requirement when the user submits the form. To set this requirement you will need to add the Collect Paypal Payment action. It allows you to set PayPal payments by submitting your Sandbox Account Email, Live Account Email, Payment Amount, Payment Frequency, and Currency preference. You can also apply tokens to the email addresses, item title and payment amount fields. 

The Collect Paypal Payment action allows you to set the requirement before giving the user access to specific resources or rights. When the users submits the form, they are redirected to the PayPal website, where they are able to complete the payment process. The user is required to log in to complete the payment process, but if he does not have a Paypal account, is required to open one.

## Payments without PayPal account

By default, PayPal requires customers that they either already have a PayPal account or create one during the checkout process. This option can be configured from PayPal so customers can buy without having a PayPal account, by using a credit card for example.
