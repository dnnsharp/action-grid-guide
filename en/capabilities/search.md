# Search

The Search functionality can be set on the grid the same as the Filter option. Firstly on the General Settings, and secondly on the fields you want to apply the search action. Keep in mind, that according to the template set on the grid, the Search functionality will differ at the layout level - we refer to the Grid and Listing layouts.
